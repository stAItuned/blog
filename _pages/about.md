I'm a rebel physicist/engineer who loves statistical data analysis. By day,
I am currently a Research Assistant on Bayesian Model Selection with
[David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/) at UPF,
Barcelona. By night I am a core developer of
[ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/) a Python package for exploratory
analysis of Bayesian models. In addition to data analysis probabilistic
modeling, I also love programming and teaching.

I think that the culture in scientific research needs deep changes towards a
more collaborative, open and diverse model. I am interested in open science,
reproducible research and science communication. I want to pursue a career in
probabilistic modeling and statistical research with special emphasis on
openness and reproducibility.

In my spare time, I like playing board games and going to the beach to do
water activities. I have been sailing and snorkeling regularly since I was
little and more recently I added kayaking to the mix too! I generally spend
the summer at the _Costa Brava_. Here I leave you a sneak peak of the views
when nobody is around
